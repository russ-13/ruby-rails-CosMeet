## **Cos-Meet - A two-sided marketplace for trading unwanted cosmetics and beauty products**

*Russell Moore*

## What problem are you solving, and why does it need solving? (R7 R8)

Quite often expensive cosmetics and beauty products go unused after a short novelty period, are purchased incorrectly, or received as unwanted gifts or samples; with perfume bottles worth hundreds of dollars sitting nearly full for years before being simply thrown out, with no centralized marketplace to trade these items to willing buyers. Many consumers build up large, expensive, and unused collections that do nothing but take up space in ever shrinking homes.

This service would allow owners (sellers) of high-end cosmetics that will ordinarily go to waste or remain unused to pass on these products to willing buyers. There are currently drips and drabs of these products on various sites, but a centralized platform would entice buys in a big way, especially as some items are ludicrously expensive and out of reach by those with more realistic budgets.

***Purpose***

Cos-Meet will provide a place for buyers and sellers to trade unwanted high-end cosmetics and beauty gadgets -  at far less than RRP. The buyers would be able to purchase products much cheaper than usual, in a safe supportive environment among fellow consumers via postage with buyers retaining a rating/trust system.

***Target Audience***

The target audience for Cos-Meet are individuals who purchase high-end cosmetic products that build up a collection over time, and are those looking to obtain these products without paying full price. The target sellers would be individuals with large collections wanting their goods to go to a good home and not be wasted – while collecting money to ‘upgrade’ their collections with more relevant items. These items can be unwanted samples or gifts, but mainly expensive products that are no longer used after the original customer wants to try a different product, this is very common with lots of people accumulating a treasure trove barely used items that are taking up valuable space in the home.

## User Stories (R12)

I'm Sally, and as a consumer in the over-saturated market of high-end cosmetics, I want to be able to on-sell my expensive items that have only been used a handful of times that I no longer am interested in, so that I can make some of my money back to purchase new items that interest me. I'd like to show an image of the product I want to sell, and include a customer description as each item will be individual as they are second-hand. I often will buy a perfume for upwards of $200, that has a significant volume, and tire of it within a few weeks or months - when the product is still nearly full. I would like to pass on that product to somebody who wants to use it and who can't necessarily afford to purchase such products brand new. Occasionally I will buy a device that I intend to use a lot, such as a UV nail dryer, use it a few times and then decide it's no longer something I want to bother with, but still is in great condition and too expensive to simply discard - and I'd like to make of the purchase price back. 

I'm Jennifer, and as consumer of cosmetics on a budget, I would like to buy higher-end products on a second-hand market that I cannot necessarily afford brand new, so that I can have a higher quality of product for my money.  I like brand names but not the price tag associated with that, and I would like a place to purchase these products and gadgets from fellow consumers in a marketplace where I can see an image and description of the exact item I'm buying, and have it delivered to me after paying in a secure environment. I would also like to see a rating of the seller who I'm dealing with for added security.

## Task Allocation (R20)

The project management tool I used for this assignment was Trello. I divided the whole task up into several categories and initiated a Trello board for the project, set up cards, and a to-do list within said cards. A rough due date was added to each card to keep the project on track. The Cos-Meet Trello board can be found here:
